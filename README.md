## So Make It issues

This repository is used for tracking issues related to the Makerspace. Anyone may contribute, but if you want to take a larger part in organising the organisation of the space then please request to be added as a collaborator - we just need your GitHub username.

### How it works

If there's an issue in the space, search for it within our issues database, and if nothing is found then create a new issue. Issues may reference other issues by their issue number, e.g. `relates to #123`.

Over time, collaborators will assign the issue some labels, a milestone, and an "assignee" - read more about these below.

### Labels

Labels are used for a variety of reasons, some (such as `wontfix` and `duplicate`) for organising the issues themselves, some for helping people to determine which issues they can help with (e.g. `Workshop`, `Electronics`, `Safety`, etc) and some to help us figure out when the issue will be discussed (e.g. `Meeting:2015-11-02`).

### Milestones

If issues need to be solved before a particular date (e.g. Defcon 4) then they will be added to the relevant milestone. Other milestones may exist for other purposes, such as "stage 1 of workshop safety", as determined by the collaborators.

### Assignees

If an issue is assigned to a person, that does not mean that it is up to that person to solve the problem. Instead it means that either we're waiting on input from that person, or that they are "in charge" of the issue - that is to say that they are the central point of contact for that issue and people should contact them about solving it. It's normal for people to self-assign issues, assigning someone else should only be done in the case that either it's been previously discussed and agreed with them, or that you're pretty sure they'll be okay with the assignment.

## Updating this document
